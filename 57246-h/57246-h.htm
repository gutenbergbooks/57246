<br />Branch of History</i></p>
<p>Kings Mountain, the fierce attack of American
frontiersmen on October 7, 1780, against Cornwallis&rsquo; scouting
force under Ferguson, was an unexpected onslaught carried out in
the foothills of South Carolina. This sudden uprising of the
stalwart Alleghany mountaineers, for the protection of their homes
and people from the threat of Tory invasion under British leadership,
was relatively isolated in conception and execution from
the main course of the Revolutionary War in the South.</p>
<p>Clearly uncontemplated in the grand British design to subjugate
the South in a final effort to end the Revolution, this accidental
encounter in the Southern Piedmont delayed incidentally,
but did not alter materially, the movement of Britain&rsquo;s Southern
Campaign. Kings Mountain is notable chiefly perhaps as supplying
the first definite forewarning of the impending British
military disasters of 1781. It was decisive to the extent that it
contributed the earliest distinct element of defeat to the final
major British campaign of the Revolution.</p>
<p>The extraordinary action occurred during one of the bleakest
periods of the Revolution. A major change in British military
strategy had again shifted the scene of action to the South in
1778. Faced by a discouraging campaign in the North and
assuming that the reputed Loyalist sympathies of the South would
be more conducive to a victory there, the British war ministry
had dictated the immediate subjugation of the South. With the
conquered Southern provinces as a base of operations, the war
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
office planned to crush Washington&rsquo;s armies in the North and
East between offensives from North and South, and thus bring
the defeat of the more stubborn Revolutionary Northern colonies.</p>
<p>Unimpeded by effective resistance, this Southern Campaign
swept unchecked through Georgia and part of South Carolina during
1778-79. The surrender of Gen. Benjamin Lincoln&rsquo;s American
army at Charleston, in May 1780, greatly strengthened the
British hold on South Carolina. Encouraged by the British successes,
the Royalist and Tory elements of the Georgia and South
Carolina lowlands rose in increasingly large numbers to the support
of the Royal cause. Soon most of South Carolina, except a
few districts in the Piedmont, were overrun by British and Royalist
forces directed by Cornwallis, and he was maturing plans for
the invasion of North Carolina. His designs were upset temporarily
by the advance of a new American Army under Gates.
Meeting Cornwallis near Camden, August 16, 1780, Gates suffered
a disastrous defeat, again leaving South Carolina and the
route northward open to the British. By September, Cornwallis
again had undertaken the invasion of North Carolina, gaining a
foothold at Charlotte, a center of Whig power, after a skirmish
there late that month.</p>
<p>The sole Southern region in the path of Cornwallis&rsquo; northward
march which had remained undisturbed by the course of
the war lay in the foothills and ranges of the Alleghanies stretching
through northwestern South Carolina, western North Carolina,
and into the present eastern Tennessee. Only here, among
the frontier settlements of the independent mountain yeoman,
could the patriotic Whigs find refuge, late in the summer of 1780,
from their despised enemies, the propertied Royalist and Tory
forces aroused by Cornwallis. Occupied with establishing a new
frontier and protecting their rude homes from the nearer threat of
the border Indians, the mountain men had been little concerned
with the war on the seaboard. The influx of partisan Whig
forces seeking sanctuary first brought the effects of war vividly
before them. But from the free and comparatively peaceful existence,
the backwoodsmen were soon to be aroused to the protection
of their homes and possessions by a threat of direct aggression.</p>

<p>That threat came from Maj. Patrick Ferguson, of Cornwallis&rsquo;
command, who, after Camden, had been ordered to operate in the
South Carolina Piedmont to suppress the Whig opposition remaining
there and to arouse the back country Tories, organizing their
strength in support of the British cause. Encountering little organized
Whig resistance, and having rapidly perfected the Tory
strength in the Piedmont, Ferguson in September 1780 undertook
a foray against Gilbert Town, a Whig outpost in North Carolina,
near the present town of Rutherfordton. Fearful of such an invasion,
the border leaders, Isaac Shelby, of Sullivan County, and
John Sevier, of Washington County, North Carolina (both now
in Tennessee), had hurried to the Watauga settlements and called
for volunteers to defeat Ferguson. They also forwarded urgent
appeals for aid to Wilkes, Surry, Burke, and Rutherford Counties
in North Carolina, and to Washington County in Virginia.</p>
<p>From Gilbert Town, early in September, Ferguson dispatched
his famed invidious threat over the mountains to the backwoodsmen,
warning them &ldquo;that if they did not desist from their opposition
to the British arms and take protection under his standard,
he would march his army over the mountains, hang their leaders,
and lay their country waste with fire and sword.&rdquo; Actually this
was but an empty gesture from Ferguson who was then preparing
one final foray across the border in South Carolina before making
a junction with Cornwallis at Charlotte. Yet, to the freedom-loving
frontier leaders the threat became a challenge which
strengthened their determination to destroy the invader. Thus
spurred, they assembled quickly, each in hunting garb, with knapsack,
blanket, and long hunting rifle, most of them mounted, but
some afoot. They were united by a strong resolve to destroy
Ferguson and his Tory force, even though they had many a
brother, cousin, or even a father among the back country men in
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
his command. In fact, the partisan and internecine warfare,
which raged during the Revolution through the southern highlands
and along the Piedmont with members of the same family
arrayed against each other as Whig and Tory, reached a climax in
the Kings Mountain expedition and engagement.</p>
<p>Assembling near the present Elizabethton, Tenn., late in September,
the mountaineers circled southeastward into upper South
Carolina, in swift pursuit of Ferguson. Joining the forces of
Shelby and Sevier were the Virginians under Campbell, and as
the expedition marched southward it was augmented by the border
fighters under McDowell and Cleveland. Though characterized
by daring impulse, the purpose of this strategic frontier
uprising had been conceived coolly by these leaders, and its execution,
in pursuit and assault, was to be brilliantly carried out.
At the Cowpens in upper South Carolina, the expedition was
joined October 6 by further volunteers under local Whig leaders,
including Chronicle, Williams, Lacey, and Hawthorne. Recruits
brought definite word of Ferguson&rsquo;s whereabouts near Kings
Mountain. And there, in a final council of war, were selected
910 stalwart fighting men, all mounted, who immediately moved
through the night upon the position of Ferguson&rsquo;s Provincial
Corps and Tory militia, now encamped atop the Kings Mountain
spur.</p>
<p>Despite the added discomfort to their already fatigued bodies
and mounts, the expedition pushed determinedly through the
cold night rain, and en route the leaders, now commanded by
Campbell, devised a final plan of attack. Having agreed to
surround the spur and gradually to close in upon its defenders
from all sides, the Whig attackers engaged the 1,104 British Provincials,
Tories, and Loyalists at about 3 o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon
of October 7, 1780. In the sanguinary one-hour engagement
that ensued along the heavily wooded and rocky slopes, the backwoodsmen,
veterans of countless border clashes even if untrained
in formal warfare, gained a complete victory, killing or capturing
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the entire British force. The most illustrious casualty was, of
course, Maj. Patrick Ferguson, the British commander.</p>
<p>The extraordinary action is memorable primarily as an example
of the personal valor and resourcefulness of the American
frontier fighter, particularly the Scotch-Irish, during the Revolution.
It demonstrated the proficiency with which he took advantage
of natural cover and capitalized upon the ineffectiveness
of the British downhill angle of fire in successfully assaulting
Ferguson&rsquo;s position. The resulting casualties clearly exhibited
the unerring accuracy of the long rifle used in skilled hands, even
when confronted with the menace of Ferguson&rsquo;s bayonet charges.
The engagement also afforded one of the most interesting demonstrations
during the Revolution of the use of the novel breechloading
Ferguson rifle. The Kings Mountain expedition and
engagement illustrated the characteristic vigor of the untrained
American frontiersman in rising to the threat of border invasion.
It recorded his military effectiveness in overcoming such a danger
and his initiative in disbanding quietly upon its passing,
especially when guided by strategy and tactics momentarily devised
by partisan leaders of the caliber of Shelby, Sevier, Campbell,
Cleveland, and Lacey.</p>
<p>To the long standing local strife between Whig and Tory, the
results of Kings Mountain were direct and considerable. It was
an unexpected blow which completely unnerved and undermined
the Loyalist organization in the Carolinas, and placed the downtrodden
Whig cause of the Piedmont in the ascendancy. Kings
Mountain was a climax to the social, economic, and military
clashes between democratic Whig and propertied Tory elements.
In a sense it epitomized this bitter struggle and its abrupt ending
on what then was the southwestern frontier. Heartening to the
long repressed Whigs, the engagement placed them in the control
of the Piedmont, and encouraged them to renewed resistance.</p>
<p>The disintegration of Loyalist power in the Carolinas after
Kings Mountain temporarily proved a real obstacle to Cornwallis&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
hitherto unchecked northward movement. The demoralization of
the Loyalist forces, which were the main reliance for local support
in the prosecution of his campaign, left Cornwallis precariously
situated in hostile North Carolina territory with a renewed Whig
threat to the rear in South Carolina. Momentarily discouraged,
he halted his North Carolina offensive and retired from his foothold
at Charlotte to a defensive position at Winnsboro, in upper
South Carolina. Here he remained inactive, with his campaign
at a standstill, until the approach of reinforcements at his rear,
under Leslie, enabled him to resume his invasion of North Carolina
early in January 1781.</p>
<p>This time Cornwallis&rsquo; march was more cautious in its initial
stages. For the enforced delay of the major British advance
occasioned by Kings Mountain and lengthened by indecision, had
enabled Greene, the new American commander in the South, to
reorganize his shattered and dispirited army and launch a renewed
and two-fold offensive upon the main British movement. It was
this offensive in 1781, which first successfully struck the British at
Cowpens, then rapidly withdrew through the Piedmont, further
dissipated Cornwallis&rsquo; energies at Guilford Courthouse, and prepared
the way for the American victory at Yorktown.</p>
<p>By providing an unexpected American victory on the South
Carolina border, Kings Mountain prevented the immediate subjugation
of the Carolinas and temporarily deranged the British
campaign to establish a completely conquered southern base of
operation. By producing a feeling of patriotic success at the
inception of the final major British campaign, Kings Mountain
contributed to the renewing of American resistance which resulted
in the British disasters of 1781.</p>

<p>Progress made on the new museum at Kings Mountain
National Military Park, South Carolina, is worthy of record, and
the fact that the Service possesses a Ferguson rifle to put into
that museum constitutes special note within the record. To the
average park visitor &ldquo;Ferguson rifle&rdquo; means little or nothing, but
to the student of military history mention of that British weapon
kindles a flame of interest. The story of how the Ferguson rifle
was pitted against the Kentucky rifle at Kings Mountain is significant
in this day of rearmament.</p>
<p>Maj. Patrick Ferguson was born in 1744, the son of a Scottish
jurist, James Ferguson of Pitfour. At an early age he became
an officer in the Royal North British Dragoons, and by the time
the American colonists revolted against British rule he had distinguished
himself in service with the Scotch militia and as an
expeditionist during the Carib insurrection in the West Indies.
In 1776 he demonstrated to British Government officials a weapon
of his own invention, &ldquo;a rifle gun on a new construction which
astonished all beholders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="585" />
<p class="pcap">BREECH MECHANISM OF THE FERGUSON RIFLE
<br /><i>Breech plug lowered by one turn of the trigger guard</i></p>
</div>
<p>The remarkable feature of the gun is its perpendicular breech
plug equipped with a screw device so as to make it possible to
lower it by a revolution of the trigger guard which serves as a
handle. When the breech plug is lowered, an opening is left
in the top of the barrel at the breech. A spherical bullet dropped
into this opening with the muzzle of the gun held downward rolls
forward through the chamber where it is stopped by the lands of
the rifling. A charge of powder then poured into the opening
fills the chamber behind the bullet, whereupon one revolution
of the trigger guard closes the breech and the weapon is ready
for priming and firing. Major Ferguson demonstrated that six
aimed shots per minute could be fired with an accuracy creditable
to any rifle. Advancing riflemen could fire four aimed shots per
minute; reloading being possible while the marksman was running.
Another great advantage of the Ferguson rifle was found
in the fact that it could be loaded while the marksman was reclining&mdash;something
quite impossible with the American rifle. A
patent was granted for the Ferguson invention on December 2,
1776, and the weapon became the first breechloader used by organized
troops of any country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>On September 11, 1777, Major Ferguson commanded the small
unit of picked riflemen of the British Army who covered the
advance of Knyphauser and his German mercenaries at Brandywine.
An American who knew nothing of breechloading rifles,
but who was possessed of the old dependable Kentucky rifle, put
a bullet into Ferguson&rsquo;s right arm, shattering the elbow. The
major&rsquo;s arm was useless thereafter and while he was recuperating
Sir William Howe jealously took advantage of his disability, disbanded
Ferguson&rsquo;s riflemen, and put into storage the superior
rifles which they had carried. This did not terminate the service
of Ferguson, nor did it relegate his rifle to the discard. His
command was restored, and he again took the field with his
handful of riflemen. At Stony Point, N. Y., and Little Egg
Harbor, N. J., he came out on top in the fighting with American
privateers and the famous Pulaski Legion. Had Great Britain
manufactured more of the Ferguson rifles, perhaps he would have
gained further victories.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Clinton&rsquo;s expedition of 1779 against Charleston,
S. C., found Ferguson and a comparatively few of his rifles active
in the depredations of several thousand Tories organized to terrorize
the rebellious colonists of the Carolinas. They invaded
the interior and operated on the very western border of the Carolinas.
For 5 months he held sway over the upcountry, enticing
or intimidating the young men of the region to enlist under the
British flag. The local militia so formed in the wild back country
were drilled by him in the ways of the British Army, and all
other inhabitants, so far as possible, were pledged to faithful
Royal service. The patriots of the interior settlements lay helpless.
Any Carolinian found in arms against the King might be&mdash;and
many were&mdash;hanged for treason. Finally, a British proclamation
was issued requiring all inhabitants to take active part on
the royalist side, which but served to bring about a notable uprising
of the Whigs who, throughout the summer of 1780,
engaged in fierce guerilla warfare against the organized Tories.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Not only did the sparsely populated settlements on the headwaters
of the Catawba, Broad, and Pacolet Rivers contribute to the
force that opposed Ferguson, but the over-mountain settlements
on the Watauga and Holston likewise sent their backwoodsmen,
all of whom were well experienced in Indian warfare. The
routes followed by these parties on their way to the Kings Mountain
rendezvous cross the present Blue Ridge National Parkway
in a number of places.</p>
<p>The unmerciful treatment of Buford&rsquo;s patriots at the hands of
Tarleton had engendered savage fury on the part of the Whigs
which was as bitterly reciprocated by the Tories. Utter refusal
of quarter was usual in many battles. In the Carolinas, hand-to-hand
encounters were common, and the contest became a war of
ruthless extermination. General Greene, writing of this condition,
said: &ldquo;The animosity between the Whigs and Tories renders
their situation truly deplorable.... The Whigs seem determined
to extirpate the Tories, and the Tories the Whigs....
If a stop cannot be put to these massacres, the country will be depopulated
in a few months more, as neither Whig nor Tory can
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In September 1780, while this spirit of hatred was at its height,
the regiments of backwoods patriots, who were to go down in
history as &ldquo;Kings Mountain Men,&rdquo; rendezvoused at South Mountain
north of Gilbert Town and determined to set upon Ferguson
and his command, then believed to be in Gilbert Town. The followers
of the Whig border leaders, Campbell, Shelby, Sevier,
Cleveland, Lacey, Williams, McDowell, Hambright, Hawthorne,
Brandon, Chronicle, and Hammond, descended upon Gilbert
Town on October 4 only to find that the Tories, apprised of the
planned attack, had evacuated that place; Ferguson was in full
retreat in an attempt to evade an engagement. His goal was
Charlotte and the safety of the British forces there stationed under
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Cornwallis. On October 6, Ferguson was attracted from his
line of march to the commanding eminence, Kings Mountain,
known at that time by the famous name that we apply today. His
1,100 loyalists went into camp on these heights, and Ferguson declared
that &ldquo;he was on Kings Mountain, that he was King of
that mountain, and God Almighty could not drive him from it.&rdquo;
He took none of the ordinary military precautions of forming
breastworks, but merely placed his baggage wagons along the
northeastern part of the mountain to give some slight appearance
of protection in the neighborhood of his headquarters.</p>
<p>The united backwoodsmen, led by Campbell, had pursued the
fleeing Tories from Gilbert Town. Spies sent forward obtained
accurate information on the numbers and intentions of the Tories.
It became evident to the Whig leaders that, if they were to overtake
their quarry before reinforcements sent by Cornwallis might
join them, a more speedy pursuit would be necessary. Accordingly,
on the night of October 5, the best men, horses, and
equipment were selected for a forced march. About 900 picked
horsemen, all well armed with the Kentucky rifle, traveled by way
of Cowpens, S. C., marching throughout the rainy night of October
6, crossed the swollen Broad River at Cherokee Ford, and on
the afternoon of October 7 came upon the Loyalists on their supposed
stronghold.</p>
<p>The story of the battle which ensued is one of the thrilling
chapters in our history. The Whigs surrounded the mountain
and, in spite of a few bayonet charges made by the Tories, pressed
up the slopes and poured into the Loyalist lines such deadly fire
from the long rifles that in less than an hour 225 had been killed,
163 wounded, and 716 made prisoners. Major Ferguson fell
with eight bullets in his body. The Whigs lost 28 killed and 62
wounded.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Probably no other battle in the Revolution was so picturesque
or so furiously fought as that at Kings Mountain. The very
mountain thundered. Not a regular soldier was in the American
ranks. Every man there was actuated by a spirit of democracy.
They fought under leaders of their own choosing for the right
to live in a land governed by men of their own choice.</p>
<p>With the death of Ferguson, the rifles of his invention, with
which probably 150 of his men were armed, disappeared. Some
were broken in the fight and others were carried off by the victors.
One given by Ferguson to his companion, De Peyster, is
today an heirloom in the family of the latter&rsquo;s descendants in New
York City. It was exhibited by the United States Government
at the World&rsquo;s Fair at Chicago in 1893. A very few are to be
found in museum collections in this country and in England.
The one possessed by the National Park Service was obtained from
a dealer in England through the vigilance of members of the
staff of the Colonial National Historical Park, Virginia, and is now
exhibited in the museum at Kings Mountain National Military
Park, South Carolina.</p>
<p>The Kings Mountain museum tells the story of the Revolutionary
backwoodsman and his place in the scheme of Americanism.
Here also is presented the story of the cultural, social, and
economic background of the Kings Mountain patriots, as well as
the details of the battle and its effect on the Revolution as a whole.
Here lies the rare opportunity to preserve for all time significant
relics of Colonial and Revolutionary days and at the same time
interpret for a multitude of visitors the basic elements in the story
of the old frontier&mdash;a story which affected most of the Nation
during the century that followed the Revolution.</p>
<p>Our interest here will turn to those intriguing reminders of
how our Colonial ancestors lived&mdash;their houses, their tools and
implements, their furniture, their books, and their guns. Because
of the significance of the American rifle in the battle of Kings
Mountain, it must be a feature of any Kings Mountain exhibit.
In the Carolinas it was as much a part of each patriot as was his
good right arm.</p>
<p>Light in weight, graceful in line, economical in consumption
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
of powder and lead, fatally precise, and distinctly American, it was
for 100 years the great arbitrator that settled all differences
throughout the American wilderness. George Washington, while
a surveyor in the back country, as scout and diplomat on his march
into the Ohio country, and while with his Virginians on Braddock&rsquo;s
fatal expedition, had formed the acquaintance of the hunters,
Indian fighters, and pioneers of the Alleghanies&mdash;riflemen all.
These men were drawn upon in 1775 to form the first units of
the United States Army, 10 companies of &ldquo;expert riflemen.&rdquo; The
British, in an attempt to compete with American accuracy of fire,
cried for J&auml;ger, German huntsmen armed with rifles, and begged
that they might be included in the contingents of German troops.</p>
<p>From the numerous written comments on the American rifle
and riflemen made by British leaders, it would be possible to quote
at length regarding the effect of American rifle fire upon British
morale and casualty lists. We may call attention again to the
statistics on the Kings Mountain dead: British, 225; American,
28. Draper records that 20 dead Tories were found behind
certain protruding rocks on the crest of the hill, and that each
victim was marked by a bullet hole in his forehead. Col. George
Hanger, British officer with Tarleton in South Carolina, provides
the following observation on the precision of American rifle fire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never in my life saw better rifles (or men who shot better)
than those made in America; they are chiefly made in Lancaster,
and two or three neighboring towns in that vicinity, in Pennsylvania.
The barrels weigh about six pounds two or three
ounces, and carry a ball no larger than thirty-six to the pound; at
least I never saw one of the larger caliber, and I have seen many
hundreds and hundreds. I am not going to relate any thing
respecting the American war; but to mention one instance,
as a proof of most excellent skill of an American rifleman. If
any man shew me an instance of better shooting, I will stand
corrected.</p>
<p>Colonel, now General Tartleton, and myself, were standing
a few yards out of a wood, observing the situation of a part of
the enemy which we intended to attack. There was a rivulet
in the enemy&rsquo;s front, and a mill on it, to which we stood directly
with our horses&rsquo; heads fronting, observing their motions. It was
an absolute plain field between us and the mill; not so much as
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
a single bush on it. Our orderly-bugle stood behind us, about
3 yards, but with his horse&rsquo;s side to our horses&rsquo; tails. A rifleman
passed over the mill-dam, evidently observing two officers,
and laid himself down on his belly; for, in such positions, they
always lie, to take a good shot at a long distance. He took a
deliberate and cool shot at my friend, at me, and the bugle-horn
man. (I have passed several times over this ground, and ever
observed it with the greatest attention; and I can positively
assert that the distance he fired from, at us, was full four hundred
yards.)</p>
<p>Now, observe how well this fellow shot. It was in the month
of August, and not a breath of wind was stirring. Colonel
Tartleton&rsquo;s horse and mine, I am certain, were not anything like
two feet apart; for we were in close consultation, how we
should attack with our troops, which laid 300 yards in the wood,
and could not be perceived by the enemy. A rifle-ball passed
between him and me; looking directly to the mill, I observed the
flash of the powder. I said to my friend, &ldquo;I think we had
better move, or we shall have two or three of these gentlemen,
shortly, amusing themselves at our expence.&rdquo; The words were
hardly out of my mouth, when the bugle horn man, behind us,
and directly central, jumped off his horse, and said, &ldquo;Sir, my
horse is shot.&rdquo; The horse staggered, fell down, and died.
He was shot directly behind the foreleg, near to the heart, at
least where the great blood-vessels lie, which lead to the heart.
He took the saddle and bridle off, went into the woods, and got
another horse. We had a number of spare horses, led by negro
lads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rifle had been introduced into America about 1700 when
there was considerable immigration into Pennsylvania from Switzerland
and Austria, the only part of the world at that time where
it was in use. It was then short, heavy, clumsy, and little more
accurate than the musket. From this arm the American gunsmiths
evolved the long, slender, small-bore gun (about 36 balls
to the pound) which by 1750 had reached the same state of
development that characterized it at the time of the Revolution.
The German J&auml;ger rifle brought to America during the Revolution
was by no means the equal of the American piece. It was
short-barreled and took a ball of 19 to the pound. With its
large ball and small powder charge its recoil was heavy and its accurate
range but little greater than that of the smoothbore musket.
It was the same gun that had been introduced into America in
1700.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The standard military firearm of the Revolutionary period was
the flintrock musket weighing about 11 pounds. Its caliber was
11 gauge, that is, it would take a lead ball of 11 to the pound.
At 100 yards a good marksman might make 40 percent of hits
on a target the size of a man standing. The musket ball, fitting
loosely in the barrel, could be loaded quickly. The fact that the
military musket always was equipped with a bayonet made it the
dependable weapon for all close fighting. As was so convincingly
shown on the occasions of the futile bayonet charges of Ferguson&rsquo;s
regulars on Kings Mountain, however, the bayonet was not effective
if enemy lines did not stand to take the punishment of hand-to-hand
fighting.</p>
<p>Each Whig on Kings Mountain had been told to act as his own
captain, to yield as he found it necessary, and to take every advantage
that was presented. In short, the patriots followed the Indian
mode of attack, using the splendid cover that the timber about
the mountain afforded, and selecting a definite human target for
every ball fired. Splendid leadership and command were exercised
by the Whig officers to make for concerted action every time
a crisis arose. This coordination, plus the Kentucky rifle and the
&ldquo;individual power of woodcraft, marksmanship, and sportsmanship&rdquo;
of each participant in the American forces, overcame all
the military training and discipline which had been injected into
his Tory troops by Ferguson.</p>

<p class="center">Modern Marksman Attains High Precision With Arm of 1776<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p class="center small"><i>By Dr. Alfred F. Hopkins, formerly Field Curator, Museum Division, Washington.</i></p>
<p>History records that on June 1, 1776, at Woolwich, England,
Maj. Patrick Ferguson, of the British Army, demonstrated
his newly devised breechloading flintrock rifle to the astonishment
of all beholders. Quite recently at the Washington laboratory
of the Museum Division of the National Park Service beholders
likewise were astonished at the shooting qualities of the Ferguson
gun.</p>
<p>While it is understood that tests of this historic arm have been
made in England within late years, it is believed that in this
country the sinister crack of a Ferguson had not been heard
since 1780 at the Battle of Kings Mountain, South Carolina.</p>
<p>Ferguson developed his rifle from two earlier types of breechloaders,
the Hardley and the Foster, upon which it was an actual
improvement, and his gun has the distinction of being the first
breechloading arm used by organized troops of any nation. The
piece is equipped with a breechplug which passes perpendicularly
through the breech of the barrel and this, having a quick-traveling
screw thread, is lowered or raised by a single revolution of the
trigger guard acting as a lever. When the breech plug is lowered,
a circular opening is left in the top of the barrel just large enough
to take a spherical bullet. In loading, the muzzle is held downward
and the ball, fitting snugly, is dropped into the opening and
permitted to roll forward to the front of the breech chamber where
it is stopped by the lands of the rifling. No wadding or patch is
used. Powder and ball rolled to form a cartridge would prove
only a hindrance and disadvantage in loading. A charge of
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
powder is poured directly from a flask or horn into the opening
behind the bullet, filling the chamber. One complete turn of
the trigger guard causes the breech plug to rise, closing the opening
and ejecting the superfluous grains of powder. When the
flashpan is primed, the piece is ready for firing. In the third
illustration of this booklet the breech mechanism and method of
loading are shown. Major Ferguson is accredited with loading
and firing six shots in one minute.</p>
<p>No recent check is known to have been made upon the number
of Ferguson rifles now in existence. They undoubtedly do
exist, but their number is probably small. Apparently only some
200 were made originally and their military use ended, owing to
lack of foresight, with the American Revolution. Six specimens
were listed in 1928 as being in collections in this country and
in England, of which one, probably two, were made by Newton,
of Grantham, two by Egg, of London, and one each by Turner
and Wilson, of London. These six guns varied somewhat in
minor details.</p>
<p>A seventh specimen, the one now possessed by the Service at
Kings Mountain National Military Park, South Carolina, bears
the name of F. Innis, Edinburgh. It is in exceptionally fine condition,
showing much of the original metal finish, and is without
replacements. The piece measures 4 feet 4&frac34; inches over all and
weighs 7&frac12; pounds. The barrel, slightly belled at the muzzle
and not designed to carry a bayonet, is 37 inches long, rifled
with 8 grooves, and takes a ball of .655 caliber. The full
length combed walnut stock is checkered at the grip and has three
brass thimbles and an engraved butt plate. On the lock plate
forward the hammer, within a scroll, is the name, F. INNIS,
and this, with the addition of EDINBURGH, together with the
proof mark and the view mark of the Gunmakers&rsquo; Company of
London, appears upon the barrel. The wooden ramrod is horn-tipped
and at the other end has a bullet worm enclosed within a
screw cap. The arm was intended for an officer.</p>

<p>The recent tests conducted indoors at the Ford&rsquo;s Theater Laboratory
were made to determine the exact method of loading the
arm, about which there had been some question, and to learn
something of its shooting qualities. Loading was found to be
extremely easy, suggesting that with practice the record set by
Major Ferguson might be attained readily. The ball, weighing
approximately 500 grains, was dropped, without patch or wad,
into the breech chamber. A charge of approximately 1&frac12; drams
of Dupont &ldquo;Fg&rdquo; black powder was poured in behind it. Closure
of the breech automatically gauged the charge, superfluous grains
being ejected. The same powder, more finely ground, was used
as priming. Several preliminary shots indicated that the rifle
had precision and accuracy. Then, at a distance of 90 feet,
three shots were fired in succession from a table rest by an expert
marksman. Number one came within a half-inch, number two
came within 4 inches, and number three came within 1&frac34; inches
of a 1&#8541;-inch bull&rsquo;s-eye.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
